## ascii-rust : simple, fast ascii art generator written in rust.

### HOW IT WORKS?
This program splits the original image into small, font-sized pieces, and simply match the proper character.

---

### TODO
**[] Improve Command line Options**
[] Image preprocessing options(Resizing, Contrast, ...etc)
[] Caching font data
[] Multi-threading(if it is fast.)
[] Support non fixed-width font(Maybe..?)
